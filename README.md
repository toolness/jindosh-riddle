This repository contains solutions to the [Jindosh Riddle][] puzzle
from *Dishonored 2* in various languages.

I think that the riddle may be randomly generated for each playthrough.
In my particular playthrough, it reads as follows:

> At the dinner party were Lady Winslow, Doctor Marcolla, Countess
> Contee, Madam Natsiou, and Baroness Finch.
>
> The women sat in a row. They all wore different colors and Countess
> Contee wore a jaunty red hat. Madam Natsiou was at the far left, next
> to the guest wearing a green jacket. The lady in purple sat left of
> someone in blue. I remember that purple outfit because the woman
> spilled her wine all over it. The traveler from Dabokva was dressed
> entirely in white. When one of the dinner guests bragged about her
> Snuff Tin, the woman next to her said they were finer in Dabokva,
> where she lived.
>
> So Lady Winslow showed off a prized Diamond, at which the lady
> from Baleton scoffed, saying it was no match for her Ring. Someone
> else carried a valuable War Medal and when she saw it, the visitor
> from Karnaca next to her almost spilled her neighbor's rum. Baroness
> Finch raised her absinthe in toast. The lady from Dunwall, full of
> whiskey, jumped up onto the table, falling onto the guest in the
> center seat, spilling the poor woman's beer. Then Doctor Marcolla
> captivated them all with a story about her wild youth in Fraeport.
>
> In the morning, there were four heirlooms under the table: the Snuff
> Tin, Bird Pendant, the Ring, and the War Medal.
>
> But who owned each?
